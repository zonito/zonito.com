Hey, I'm Love Sharma. This is Personal Website; I intend to showcase my work, thoughts, and a little about personal things.

I'm currently working with Autodesk, Singapore as a Principal Software Engineer. I worked on various projects and currently working on User Management System, a.k.a Identity.

Before Autodesk, I worked with Google, India, to build a training enrollment system for DoubleClick Customers, [Google Tag Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-legacy-by-g/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk) (Used by more than 2M+ Users) and a few more internal tools.

I'm actively involved in a few StartUps (i.e., [Prediction Guru](https://www.prediction.guru/), [PolySport](https://www.polysports.org/), and a few more.) as a Technical Advisor.

My area of interest are:

- Solution Architecture / Problem Solving
- Agile Methodologies
- Continuous Integration & Deployment
- Distributed system implementation
- Microservices development
- Product Development
- API Management
- Cloud Infrastructures
- User Experiences
- Gamification / Game mechanics

Apart from professional activities, I love to read books or blogs on Psychologies ([Mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness), [Transpersonal Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpersonal_psychology), etc.), Philosophies ([Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta), [Śūnyavāda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana#%C5%9A%C5%ABnyav%C4%81da), etc.), and Technologies during my leisure time. Lastly, I am a proud father of two kids.
